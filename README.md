# ROS-ManyEars
ManyEars multi-microphone (microphone array) sound localization system. 
Using multiple microphones built into the robot body, together with some
custom electronics, the ManyEars system attempts to determine the direction
from which sound is coming from. This directory contains ROS nodes for that
system.

See the [ManyEars github repo](https://github.com/introlab/manyears) for more info.

## Status
The ManyEars system was used experimentally in 2016 but did not work in a 
sufficiently reliable fashion (for the rather unusual microphone placements
in the robot body), and is not currently used in any Hanson Robotics products.

Meanwhile, the ManyEars system itself has been supplanted by the newer
[ODAS system](https://github.com/introlab/odas) for sound localization.
